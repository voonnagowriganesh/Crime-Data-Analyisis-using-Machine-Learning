# Crime Prediction and Analysis Platform

Criminal cases are rapidly increasing in our society day to day. These leading to backlog of pending cases. It is important to control the increasing crimes else it becomes tough to handle for Law Enforcement Agencies, they store the information of every crime after happening because there might be a chance of Pattern behind the occurrence of every crime so in order to control the crimes we are going to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the Crime pattern by training the model through  K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Algorithm to get more predictions accurately than existed Algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree etc…
Already the people worked on KNN algorithm to train model they used the  dataset and get prediction rate of 75% but now we  are working on same algorithm to get more than 85%. Also we used to work on this approach to reduce the code complexity. We would show the chance of occurrence of next two crime types based on our dataset. We collected the dataset from data.govern.in at the period of 2023 Jan - 2024 Jan
